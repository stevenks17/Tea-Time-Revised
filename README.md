# Tea Time Revised

TeaTime is a rails web app that allows a user who has signed up to add tea brands and blends with a brief description and then review teas. 

## Installation

Using bundle install to install dependencies and then running rails server will get the site up and running.
```bash
bundle install
```
```bash
rails s
```

## Usage

The web app can be used as a base domain to create a application that will engage users to create tea blends and review them. 


## Roadmap

The future goal may be to create a open source meetup application based on tea preferences.
